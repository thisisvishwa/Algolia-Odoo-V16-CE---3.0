# User Guide for Odoo eCommerce Search with Algolia Integration

Welcome to the user guide for the enhanced search functionality on your Odoo Version 16 Community Edition eCommerce website. This guide will walk you through the features and how to use the Algolia-powered search to find products quickly and efficiently.

## Getting Started with Search

To begin using the advanced search features, simply navigate to the search bar on the website. The search bar is easy to locate and is designed to be user-friendly.

### Using the Search Bar

- **Instant Suggestions**: As you type in the search bar, you will see instant suggestions drop down below the input field. These suggestions are there to help you refine your query quickly.
- **Typo-Tolerance**: Don't worry about typos! Our search is equipped with Algolia's typo-tolerance feature, which means it will still understand what you're looking for, even with a few misspelled letters.

### Navigating Search Results

Once you've entered your query and hit the `search_button` or pressed Enter, you'll be taken to the `search_results_page.xml` where you can see all the relevant products.

- **Visually Appealing Layout**: Each product is displayed with essential information, making it easy to scan through results.
- **Customizable Views**: You can customize what information you see in the search results through the settings in the Odoo Backend module.

## Filtering and Refining Results

To help you find exactly what you're looking for, you can use the faceting and filtering options.

- **Faceted Search**: On the side of the search results, you'll find the `facet_filters` container. Here, you can filter results by various attributes like category, price, and more.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: You can add or remove filters without having to reload the page, making your search experience seamless and efficient.

## Mobile Search Experience

Our search is fully optimized for mobile devices. When you access the website on your phone or tablet, the `responsive_search` elements will adjust to fit your screen size, ensuring you get the same great search experience.
